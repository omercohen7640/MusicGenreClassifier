project plan:
1. build 1D conv-net. input: 30-second waveform and classify the genre.



feature list for improvement (1d convnet):
1. cut the songs to k-seconds part and enlagre the trainig set. need to decide the size of k.
2. cut the songs in multiple spots in the song.
3. need to do some research about audio data augmentation.
4. add dropout to network
5. check for an easy way to pad the tracks with zeros
6. build warmup section
7. try to nomralize feature-wize
8. discuss batchnorm because batch size is small


feature list for 2d convnet:
1. add 2d convnet and concat the feature to one big feature vector with the 1d convnet
2. read hyper-parameters from config file

presentation and git tasks:
1. train all models and present the results
